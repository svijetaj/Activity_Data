Analysis on activity data and writing mark down file
## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
4
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a
5
[Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike
6
Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or
7
[Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of
8
the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take
9
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to
10
find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But
11
these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to
12
obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for
13
processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
16
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
17
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
18
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
19
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.
